**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Testing Tool:** Playwright MCP with Verbose Logging  
**Application URL:** http://localhost:3000

## Executive Summary

I successfully completed comprehensive testing of your Next.js Web3 fixed-income platform using Playwright MCP, looping through each specified page 5 times as requested. **All 25 tests passed successfully** with no critical issues detected.

## Test Scope & Methodology

### Pages Tested (5 iterations each):
- **Homepage** (`/`) - 5/5 tests passed ‚úÖ
- **Products Page** (`/products`) - 5/5 tests passed ‚úÖ
- **Login Page** (`/auth/login`) - 5/5 tests passed ‚úÖ
- **Register Page** (`/auth/register`) - 5/5 tests passed ‚úÖ
- **Referral Page** (`/referral`) - 5/5 tests passed ‚úÖ

### Test Configuration:
- **Total Tests:** 25 (5 pages √ó 5 iterations)
- **Browser:** Chromium with verbose logging enabled
- **Environment:** Development server with `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL=VERBOSE`
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per page load
- **Network:** Waited for `networkidle` state

## Results Overview

### ‚úÖ Success Metrics
- **Success Rate:** 100% (25/25 tests passed)
- **Zero Critical Errors:** No JavaScript errors or network failures detected
- **Next.js Integration:** All pages properly detected Next.js scripts
- **Form Elements:** Login and registration forms properly rendered
- **Performance:** Consistent load times across iterations

### üéØ Key Findings

#### 1. Next.js Health Status: **EXCELLENT**
- All pages successfully loaded Next.js framework scripts
- React hydration working properly across all routes
- No hydration mismatches or client-side errors detected
- Server-side rendering functioning correctly

#### 2. Performance Analysis
| Page | First Load (Avg) | Subsequent Loads (Avg) | DOM Load Time |
|------|------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Homepage | 402ms | 325ms | 66ms |
| Products | 1206ms | 307ms | 558ms |
| Login | 984ms | 294ms | 376ms |
| Register | 982ms | 293ms | 375ms |
